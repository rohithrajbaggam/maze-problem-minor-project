# Minor Project - 2

# Maze Solver

- 2D Grids
- Will give start and end point and finds shortest path between to points

## Key Objective

→ grids, obstacles, free blocks.

→ Path from starting to ending point

→ Algorthm for find the shortest Path

→ GUI For Applications

### Technologies

```python
Java
JavaSwing
JFrame
```

### Array Traversal

- Accessing each element given in an array. So that each data is validated.

### To Access & Check

- 1 is a blocker
- 0 is accessible
- 9 is destination

## DFS → (Depth first Search)

**⇒ Requirements of DFS in project**

- Algorithm to traversal and search in a 2D array
- It reaches out far away for starting point
- Return when it reaches destination.
- It marks the elements, nodes visited when it traverse through it.

## Algorithm
